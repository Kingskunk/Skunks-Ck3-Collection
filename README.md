# Skunks-Ck3-Collection
Skunks Ck3 Collection, just a few edits to some mods, main a compatch between Immersive Realm Laws and Last Will, a quick update for More Background Illustrations,  a Ui edit for  Divine Intervention Cheat Menu and some personal changes to  Convert Resources to make it more balanced.

If you're using Irony Mod Manager, the .json is there for you to import the load order.
